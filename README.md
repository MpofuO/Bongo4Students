# Bongo4Students
The upgraded version of Bongo that uses the BongoAPI and has additional functionality and better UI. Go to https://github.com/MpofuO/PublishedBongo/blob/main/README.md to access the readme of the version directly before this one.

## New Features
- *Merge with friends*: Bongo now allows users to merge their timetables so they can easily know at what times are they all free.
- *API utilization*: Bongo now uses an API instead of directly connecting to the database for timetable features.
